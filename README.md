# The QuKayDee QKD network simulator

The bash scripts in this repository are intended to be used in conjunction with
QuKayDee ([https://qukaydee.com](https://qukaydee.com)) which is a cloud-based
[Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution)
network simulator.

The simulated QKD network running in QuKayDee consists of simulated QKD devices that produce
encryption keys.
These encryption keys are stored in simulated Key Management Systems (KMSs) that also run in
QuKayDee.

The users of QuKayDee have encryption devices at their own location, outside of QuKayDee.
These encryption devices consume the keys that are produced by by simulated QKD devices and stored
in the simulated KMS devices.

The simulated KMS devices in QuKayDee provide a standard REST API defined in
[ETSI QKD 014](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/QKD/001_099/014/01.01.01_60/gs_qkd014v010101p.pdf)
for delivering the generated encryption keys to the user's encryptors.

See the QuKayDee tutorial
([https://qukaydee.com/pages/tutorial](https://qukaydee.com/pages/tutorial))
for more details.

# Client certificates and keys

The ETSI QKD 014 standard uses the following terminology:

 * The key management system (KMS) device is called a Key Management Entity (KME).

 * The encryptor device is called a Secure Application Entity (SAE).

Furthermore, the ETSI QKD 014 standard uses mutual authentication transport
layer security (mTLS) between the KMS (which is the server) and the SAE (which is the client).

This means that the KME servers running in QuKayDee need client certificates for each SAE client
that is allowed to retrieve keys.

One approach would be to upload a client certificate for each authorized SAE to QuKayDee, but that
would be very cumbersome.

Instead, we use the following simpler approach:

 1. Generate one single self-signed client root certificate authority (CA) certificate and key.

 2. Also, generate one additional client certificate for each client SAE, and sign those
    certificates using the client CA key from step 1 above.

 3. Upload only the client CA from step 1 certificate to QuKayDee (using the
    Upload Client CA Certificate button in the API screen).

 4. The KME server running in QuKayDee can authenticate the SAE client using the client CA
    certificate uploaded in step 3. The client SAE certificate generated in step 2 does not
    need to be uploaded; the client provides it as part of the initial TLS protocol handshake.

# Generating client certificates and keys

The bash script `generate-client-root-ca-certificate-and-key.sh` generates the client CA certificate
and key.

You only need to run this script once, regardless of how many SAEs there are.

You must have `openssl` installed on your computer to run this script.

The script takes no arguments and produces no output:

<pre>
$ <b>generate-client-root-ca-certificate-and-key.sh</b>
$
</pre>

It creates two files that contain the client CA certificate and key:

<pre>
$ <b>ls</b>
...
client-root-ca.crt
client-root-ca.key
...
</pre>

Upload the generate filed `client-root-ca.crt` to QuKayDee by selecting API
in the menu and clicking on the Upload Client CA Certificate button.

Once you have create the client CA certificate and key, you also need to generate one client
certificate for each SAE (i.e. for each encryptor) that consumes keys generated by QyKayDee.

The script takes the SAE identifier (SAE ID) as its only argument and produces no output:

<pre>
$ <b>generate-client-sae-certificate-and-key.sh sae-1</b>
$
</pre>

It creates three files that contain the client SAE certificate and key:

<pre>
$ <b>ls</b>
...
sae-1.crt
sae-1.key
sae-1.pem
...
</pre>

The `.crt` file contains the SAE certificate,
the `.key` file contains the SAE private key,
and the `.pem` file contains the SAE private key plus the entire certificate chain
(client CA certificate and SAE certificate).

None of these three files is uploaded to QuKayDee;
instead they are used when the client invokes an ETSI QKD API
(see `curl` example below).

# Server certificates and keys

So far, we have described how to generate the client certificate and client key that the SAE uses to
authenticate itself to the KME.

Each KME also needs a server certificate and a server private key to authenticate itself to the SAE.

The bash scripts in this repository are _not_ intended to generate these server certificates and
private keys.
Instead, the cloud-hosted QuKayDee software generates the server certificate and the private key
for each KME.

Once again, one possible approach would be to download a separate server certificate
for each KME, but that would be cumbersome.

Instead, QuKayDee generates one single self-signed server root certificate authority (CA)
certificate and key for all KMEs.

You can download this server CA certificate by going to the API menu and clicking on the
Download Server CA Certificate button.

This downloads the following file into the Downloads folder on your computer:

<pre>
$ <b>ls</b>
account-1-server-ca-qukaydee-com.crt
</pre>

The `account-1` in the filename is the account identifier for your account in QuKayDee
(each user gets a different server CA certificate).

Move this file to the same directory where your client certificates and keys are.
